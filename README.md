- Hi everyone, I’m Addison.
- My background is primarily in advertising and writing copy. Recently I decided to dedicate some time to learning how to code since I think it will complement my current set of skills and help bring more value to the teams I work with.
- I’m currently starting with learning HTML/HTML5 & CSS. Once I'm comfortable with those languages, I plan to move onto JavaScript & C#. 
- A friend of mine who works as a Senior Program Developer recommended that I create a GitHub account to track my efforts. 
- Looking forward to this journey and learning new things!
